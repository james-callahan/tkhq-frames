# recovery

This repository contains code for the recovery component of Turnkey. This self-contained HTML page is meant to be used as a standalone document to help first-party Turnkey root users. It's also going to be embedded as an iframe to help with sub-org root recovery.

This page is hosted on Github pages at https://tkhq.github.io/recovery/
